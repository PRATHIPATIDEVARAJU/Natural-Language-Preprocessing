    "# 🌍 Introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, process, and generate human language. It is a multidisciplinary domain that combines **linguistics, computer science, and machine learning** to bridge the gap between human communication and machine understanding.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of NLP is to allow computers to process large amounts of **textual or spoken data** in a way that is both meaningful and useful. It involves various **computational techniques** to analyze and manipulate human language, making it possible for machines to perform tasks such as **language translation, speech recognition, sentiment analysis, text summarization, chatbots, and more.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "NLP is an essential component of many **real-world applications**, including **virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, search engines like Google, spam detection in emails, and customer support automation.** It is widely used in fields such as **healthcare, finance, e-commerce, and education** to enhance user experience and automate communication-based tasks.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a **branch of artificial intelligence** that focuses on the interaction between **computers and human languages.** It enables computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data in a way that allows them to **understand, interpret, generate, and respond** to human communication effectively.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, NLP involves the following key tasks:  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Understanding (Natural Language Understanding - NLU)\n",
    "- Recognizing and processing **human language** in a structured format  \n",
    "- Identifying **syntax, semantics, and context** within text  \n",
    "- Converting **unstructured text data** into machine-readable structured information  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Processing (Natural Language Processing - NLP)\n",
    "- Tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and parsing of text  \n",
